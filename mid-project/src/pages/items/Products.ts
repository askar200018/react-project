To ensure the maximum efficiency of these models, we have developed the innovative Soft Air technology, which is exclusive to Roca.

As no separate cistern is required, the new In-Tank toilets take less space and therefore allow greater design freedom for the bathroom.",

Also, the car lights at night are more stirring for him that draw him more towards his new room (thereby encouraging him to sleep alone as a daily practice) which has been the intent and demand of the client since the very beginning. Hence, the whole assembly becomes much more fun for him and engrosses him to an extreme level thereby adding value to his life and studies. The study table and low height zip bed with curved side tables have been specifically designed with no sharp edges and corners adding to the softness of the room and catering to his taste as well.",
